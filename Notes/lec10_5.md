# Lecture 10.5 (Basics of IP Addressing)

1. IP Address is used to identify a host using 32 bits having 4 bytes
2. A host must have a NIC (Network Interface Card)

## Subnet Mask
Determines what part of the IP address is the network part and what part is the host part.

## Network Address
This is given by $N0\ldots 0$ where $N$ is the network part in bits

## Classes of IP Addresses
a. Class A (1-126, 127 reserved for loopback address)
    - N.H.H.H policy, where only the first byte is the network byte
    - Subnet mask = 255.0.0.0
    - Total number of hosts = $2^{24}-2$
b. Class B (128-191)
    - N.N.H.H
    - Subnet mask = 255.255.0.0
    - #hosts = $2^{16}-2$
c. Class C (192-223)
    - N.N.N.H
    - Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0
    - #hosts = $2^8-2$
d. Class D (224-239)
    - used for multicasting
e. Class E (240-255)
    - used for experimenting

## Private IP Addresses
a. Class A: 10.0.0.0
b. Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.0.0
c. Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.0

## Types of Addressing
MAC address is 12 hexadecimal values

### Unicast Address
IP + MAC address uniquely determines the address

### Broadcast Address
This is given by $N1\ldots 1$ where $N$ is the network part in bits and MAC address is all F's

### Multicast Address
IP address in `Class D` and MAC address begins with 01-00-5E

## Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR)
IP/x is used where x determines the number of bits which represent the network address

## Dynamic IP Addressing
1. Dynamically assigns an IP address
1. Uses DCHP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
1. IP addresses are leased for some period of time
